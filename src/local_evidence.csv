For the software company, see DataViz . Professor Edward Tufte described Charles Joseph Minard 's 1869 graphic of the French invasion of Russia as potentially ""the best statistical graphic ever drawn"", noting it captures 6 variables in 2 dimensions. Data and information visualization ( data viz/vis or info viz/vis ) is the practice of designing and creating graphic or visual representations of quantitative and qualitative data and information with the help of static, dynamic or interactive visual items. These visualizations are intended to help a target audience visually explore and discover, quickly understand, interpret and gain important insights into otherwise difficult-to-identify structures, relationships, correlations, local and global patterns, trends, variations, constancy, clusters, outliers and unusual groupings within data. When intended for the public to convey a concise version of information in an engaging manner, it is typically called infographics . Data visualization is concerned with presenting sets of primarily quantitative raw data in a schematic form, using imagery. The visual formats used in data visualization include charts and graphs, geospatial maps , figures, correlation matrices , percentage gauges , etc..

First square shows his ordering the translation; second square, the translation being made. Third and fourth squares show the finished translation being brought to, and then presented to, the King. Translation is the communication of the meaning of a source-language text by means of an equivalent target-language text. The English language draws a terminological distinction (which does not exist in every language) between translating (a written text) and interpreting (oral or signed communication between users of different languages); under this distinction, translation can begin only after the appearance of writing within a language community. A translator always risks inadvertently introducing source-language words, grammar , or syntax into the target-language rendering. On the other hand, such ""spill-overs"" have sometimes imported useful source-language calques and loanwords that have enriched target languages. Because of the laboriousness of the translation process, since the 1940s efforts have been made, with varying degrees of success, to automate translation or to mechanically aid the human translator",0.75

The Spirit of the Age (full title The Spirit of the Age: Or, Contemporary Portraits ) is a collection of character sketches by the early 19th century English essayist, literary critic , and social commentator William Hazlitt , portraying 25 men, mostly British, whom he believed to represent significant trends in the thought, literature, and politics of his time. The subjects include thinkers, social reformers, politicians, poets, essayists, and novelists, many of whom Hazlitt was personally acquainted with or had encountered. Originally appearing in English periodicals, mostly The New Monthly Magazine in 1824, the essays were collected with several others written for the purpose and published in book form in 1825. The Spirit of the Age was one of Hazlitt's most successful books. It is frequently judged to be his masterpiece, even ""the crowning ornament of Hazlitt's career, and ... one of the lasting glories of nineteenth-century criticism."" Hazlitt was also a painter and an art critic, yet no artists number among the subjects of these essays. His artistic and critical sensibility, however, infused his prose style—Hazlitt was later judged to be one of the greatest of English prose stylists as well —enabling his appreciation of portrait painting to help him bring his subjects to life.

The legacy of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor has had many effects on the world. Despite his reputation as ""the last knight"" (and his penchant for personally commanding battles and leading a peripatetic court), as a politician, Maximilian also carried out ""herculean tasks of bureaucracy"" every day of his adult life (the emperor boasted that he could dictate, simultaneously, to half a dozen secretaries). At the same time, James M. Bradburne remarks that, ""Naturally every ruler wanted to be seen as a victor, but Maximilian aspired to the role of Apollo Musagetes ."" The circle of humanists gathered around him and other contemporary admirers also tended to depict him as such. Maximilian was a universal patron, whose intellect and imagination, according to historian Sydney Anglo, made the courtier of Castiliogne look like a scaled-down version. Anglo points out, though, that the emperor treated his artists and scholars like mere tools (whom he also tended to fail to pay adequately or timely) to serve his purposes, and never autonomous forces. Maximilian did not play the roles of the sponsor and commissioner only, but as organizer, stimulator and planner, he joined the creative processes, drew up the programmes, suggested improvements, checked and decided on the ",0.75

For the software company, see DataViz . Professor Edward Tufte described Charles Joseph Minard 's 1869 graphic of the French invasion of Russia as potentially ""the best statistical graphic ever drawn"", noting it captures 6 variables in 2 dimensions. Data and information visualization ( data viz/vis or info viz/vis ) is the practice of designing and creating graphic or visual representations of quantitative and qualitative data and information with the help of static, dynamic or interactive visual items. These visualizations are intended to help a target audience visually explore and discover, quickly understand, interpret and gain important insights into otherwise difficult-to-identify structures, relationships, correlations, local and global patterns, trends, variations, constancy, clusters, outliers and unusual groupings within data. When intended for the public to convey a concise version of information in an engaging manner, it is typically called infographics . Data visualization is concerned with presenting sets of primarily quantitative raw data in a schematic form, using imagery. The visual formats used in data visualization include charts and graphs, geospatial maps , figures, correlation matrices , percentage gauges , etc.. Information visualization deals with multiple, large-scale and complicated datasets which contain quantitative data, as well as qualitative, and primarily abstract information, and its goal ",0.75

Not to be confused with Transliteration or Word-sense disambiguation . King Charles V the Wise commissions a translation of Aristotle . First square shows his ordering the translation; second square, the translation being made. Third and fourth squares show the finished translation being brought to, and then presented to, the King. Translation is the communication of the meaning of a source-language text by means of an equivalent target-language text. The English language draws a terminological distinction (which does not exist in every language) between translating (a written text) and interpreting (oral or signed communication between users of different languages); under this distinction, translation can begin only after the appearance of writing within a language community. A translator always risks inadvertently introducing source-language words, grammar , or syntax into the target-language rendering. On the other hand, such ""spill-overs"" have sometimes imported useful source-language calques and loanwords that have enriched target languages. Because of the laboriousness of the translation process, since the 1940s efforts have been made, with varying degrees of success, to automate translation or to mechanically aid the human translator",0.75

The Spirit of the Age (full title The Spirit of the Age: Or, Contemporary Portraits ) is a collection of character sketches by the early 19th century English essayist, literary critic , and social commentator William Hazlitt , portraying 25 men, mostly British, whom he believed to represent significant trends in the thought, literature, and politics of his time. The subjects include thinkers, social reformers, politicians, poets, essayists, and novelists, many of whom Hazlitt was personally acquainted with or had encountered. Originally appearing in English periodicals, mostly The New Monthly Magazine in 1824, the essays were collected with several others written for the purpose and published in book form in 1825. The Spirit of the Age was one of Hazlitt's most successful books. It is frequently judged to be his masterpiece, even ""the crowning ornament of Hazlitt's career, and ... one of the lasting glories of nineteenth-century criticism."" Hazlitt was also a painter and an art critic, yet no artists number among the subjects of these essays. His artistic and critical sensibility, however, infused his prose style—Hazlitt was later judged to be one of the greatest of English prose stylists as well —enabling his appreciation of portrait painting to help him bring his subjects to life. His experience as a literary, political, and social critic contributed to Hazlitt's solid understanding of his subjects' ac",0.75

The canopy is adorned with the solar symbol and the imperial coat-of-arms. The inscription states: ""That which the sun is in the heavens, the Emperor is on earth."" The legacy of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor has had many effects on the world. Despite his reputation as ""the last knight"" (and his penchant for personally commanding battles and leading a peripatetic court), as a politician, Maximilian also carried out ""herculean tasks of bureaucracy"" every day of his adult life (the emperor boasted that he could dictate, simultaneously, to half a dozen secretaries). At the same time, James M. Bradburne remarks that, ""Naturally every ruler wanted to be seen as a victor, but Maximilian aspired to the role of Apollo Musagetes ."" The circle of humanists gathered around him and other contemporary admirers also tended to depict him as such. Maximilian was a universal patron, whose intellect and imagination, according to historian Sydney Anglo, made the courtier of Castiliogne look like a scaled-down version. Anglo points out, though, that the emperor treated his artists and scholars like mere tools (whom he also tended to fail to pay adequately or timely) to serve his purposes, and never autonomous forces. Maximilian did not play the roles of the sponsor and commissioner only, but as organizer, stimulator and planner, he joined the creative processes, drew up the programmes, suggested improvements, checked and decided on the ",0.75
